       <h1>Travel to catacombs of Paris! </h1>
       
        <p> Imagine that you are in a place where there are a lot of bodies of people who are no longer alive and now you can only see their bones that are even worn out by the passing of the years and can you also feel that they look at you, that they judge you and that you feel a bad vibe from anywhere? Or maybe good vibes? </p>
        <h4> You can find out here! </h4>
        <p> Called the biggest cemetery in the world as there are more than 6 million bones counted to date </p>

      <p> Only a small part of these are open to the public since the rest is quite unstable and there are even areas that have not been explored. </p>
        <p> In 1786, to fight the epidemics and diseases that were devastating the population, it was decided to move the corpses and bones from various cemeteries in the city to the catacombs. </p> 
        <p> You can see: </p>
        <ul> 
            <li> Structures made of bones
            <li> Shapes made of bones
        </ul>

        <h4> Things that happened there</h4>
        <ol>
            <li> People die
            <li> People get lost
            <li> People disappeared
        </ol>
        <p> But don't worry, there's nothing to fear anymore (I think so) </p>
